# RAG-based Chat with PDF
This project enables conversational interaction with PDF documents using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. Users can ask questions related to the content of uploaded PDF files, and the system will provide detailed responses using RAG-based conversation generation techniques.

# Features
PDF Upload: Users can upload one or multiple PDF files containing the information they want to inquire about.

Text Extraction: Extracts text content from uploaded PDF files for processing and analysis.

Text Chunking: Splits the extracted text into smaller chunks for efficient processing and retrieval.

Vector Store Creation: Utilizes FAISS to create a vector store from the text chunks, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of relevant information.

Conversational Interface: Utilizes the RAG model to generate responses to user queries in a conversational manner.

# Tech Stack
Python: Programming language used for development.
Streamlit: Web application framework for building interactive web applications.
PyPDF2: Python library for reading PDF files.
Langchain: Framework for developing RAG model using LLM.
FAISS: Library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
Anthropic: API for claude-3-sonnet-20240229 LLM.
